"## Ocr_geminiAI"  

This repository is still in creation!


This repository is an improved version of my previous repository on reading and locating old directories. 
It contains an input folder with folders containing Canadian cities. Inside every folder, there is a scan of one or more pages in PDF format.

The code follows this process:
1. Crop images
2. Read scans with Gemini AI
3. Locate the directories

The code is written in Python and is not yet finished. A better description will be uploaded when all code is completed.
